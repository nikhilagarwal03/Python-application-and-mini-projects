"""
 Challenge: Friendship Compatibility Calculator

Build a Python script that calculates a fun "compatibility score" between two friends based on their names.

Your program should:
1. Ask for two names (friend A and friend B).
2. Count shared letters, vowels, and character positions to create a compatibility
score (0-100).
3. Display the percentage with a themed message like:
   "You're like chai and samosa â€” made for each other!" or 
   "Well... opposites attract, maybe?"

Bonus:
- Use emojis in the result
- Give playful advice based on the score range
- Capitalize and center the final output in a framed box
